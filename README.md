#Time Complexity Comparisons 

This is small notebook that tests the run time of different type of code implementations. Each function is a representation of a different approach to solving a problem. Most of them are classic examples of different time complexity solutions to predicting Fibonacci numbers. Random variables are chosen for each problem and then preformed a pre-determined number of times. The length of time that each approach takes is then printed after the cell runs.
